    <h1>Mission & Mindset â€” AI and Business Intelligence for SMEs</h1>
    <p><em>March 2024 â€” by Rosario Sapienza</em></p>
  </section>
<section><h2>ðŸ“Œ Introduction</h2><p>For a long time Iâ€™ve been obsessed with bringing AI and Business Intelligence to small and mid-sized companies â€” not as buzzwords, but as tools that actually move the needle. This project is where engineering discipline meets data craftsmanship.</p></section>
<section><h2>ðŸ“Œ What â€˜AI Financeâ€™ stands for</h2><p>We design lean, value-driven analytics: dashboards that answer real questions, predictive models that inform decisions, and automation that removes friction from daily operations. The goal is to turn data into an operating advantage.</p></section>
<section><h2>ðŸ“Œ Fears & Expectations</h2><p>Every new venture comes with uncertainty. My fears are simple: building features that donâ€™t matter, over-engineering, or speaking a language that business owners donâ€™t care about. My expectation: focus on impact â€” measurable, pragmatic, and fast to deploy.</p></section>
<section><h2>ðŸ“Œ Call to Action</h2><p>If you run a growing business and want clarity from your data, letâ€™s start small: one problem, one metric, one dashboard. Then we iterate.</p></section>
